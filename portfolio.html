        <p>Since graduating college I’ve been honing my skills as a programmer.  I’m well versed in Java, C++, javascript css and now I have recently been introduced to python. Along with my abilities as a programmer, I'm an extroverted person with many passions and curiosities. I've had jobs in sales, the service industry, event planning, and design; all of which fed my soul to grow into the artist I am today.

            <p>If you don’t give it your all , you don’t deserve it . In the trials of my life, coding was not always what brought me inspiration, but it did present me with a challenge. Challenges are the fuel to my fire. I believe that there is no knowledge or skill that I cannot learn, practice and master. Anyone who I’ve worked with in the past will confirm that I abide by that mentality.  </p>
             <p>My abundant energy for creation has lead me to pursue many interests. I'm a songwriter and a guitarist, among many other artistic endeavours. Throughout my life I’ve been able to develop myself in many areas; a path that has lead me into software engineering.</p>

            <p>Along with my interests, I’m also a people person with a deep emotional capacity for empathy, a great storyteller and passionate creator.  I love to talk and share with others, and that has been an asset to me as a sales person for the past few years. I am now seeking a job in software development in any area to continue on my journey. I’m confident in my abilities, so please feel free to get in touch by any means of communication.</p>
