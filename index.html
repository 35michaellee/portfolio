        <p>Since graduating college I’ve been honing my skills as a programmer.  I’m well versed in Java, C++, javascript css
             and now I have recently been introduced to python.
             Along with my abilities as a programmer, I'm an extroverted person 
             with many passions and curiosities.Im excited to find a place where I can work with talented programmers to build projects and sharpen my own skills in this evolving world of technology.
              I've had jobs in sales, the service industry, event planning, and design; all of which fed my soul to grow into the artist I am today. 
            </p>

            <p>If you don’t give it your all , you don’t deserve it . In the trials of my life, coding was not always what brought me inspiration, but it did present me with a challenge. Challenges are the fuel to my fire. I believe that there is no knowledge or skill that I cannot learn, practice and master. Anyone who I’ve worked with in the past will confirm that I abide by that mentality.</p>
            <p>My abundant energy for creation has lead me to pursue many interests. I'm a songwriter and a guitarist, among many other artistic endeavours. Throughout my life I’ve been able to develop myself in many areas; a path that has lead me into software engineering.</p>
            <p>Along with my interests, I’m also a people person with a deep emotional capacity for empathy, a great storyteller and passionate creator.  I love to talk and share with others, and that has been an asset to me as a sales person for the past few years. I am now seeking a job in software development in any area to continue on my journey. I’m confident in my abilities, so please feel free to get in touch by any means of communication.</p>
